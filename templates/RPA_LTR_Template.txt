(Note: This screenshot should showcase high‐level or summary metrics distinct from those below.)

Exec LTR View:
• Display a different set of “key metrics” or additional details, so it’s not duplicating the KPI screenshot.
• Use green for favorable metrics, red for unfavorable (conditional formatting).
• Include RPA metrics (bot uptime, automation success rates, processing times, error rates, etc.).

Roadmap & Next Step Updates (reference WBR Notes & JIRA CSV Data):
• Leverage insights from WBR notes/chat and JIRA data to detail upcoming tasks.
• For each person (Edu, Asim, Waseyt, and Donn), include 2 roadmap items.
• For each item, note:
  o Due date (JIRA data)
  o The Business SME or stakeholder
  o The expected weekly ROI
• Where applicable, mention upcoming RPA initiatives (e.g., scaling new automation features or further bot enhancements).

Detail Notes:
• Provide any supporting notes that didn’t make the top 3 Key Updates.

Detail LTR:
• Link or reference any detailed LTRs that roll up into the main Exec LTR.

Deep Dives / Top 3 Review (optional):
• Include your top 3 deep dives from last week (if applicable).
• Call out main learnings from each deep dive.
